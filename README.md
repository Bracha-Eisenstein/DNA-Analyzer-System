# DNA-Analyzer-System
## Description
A system through which DNA sequences can be investigated.
The system makes it possible to create a lot of manipulations on the sequences: searching for certain sections, replacing genes, etc.
Communication with the system is done in the form of CLI (command line interface). Using this interface the user will be able to load DNA sequences from files, analyze and manipulate them.

In terms of application, the system is a combination of Design Patterns and efficient data structures



## Common Usage of the DNA Analyzer
Source Sequences The DNA Analyzer application will help our scientists in their genetic and biologicalresearch. For example, a common usage might be to hold 10--20 human DNAsequences (single- or double-strand), and have the research on them.Each such a sequence is about 1.510^9 nucleotides long for the single strand, or 3109nucleotides long for the double strand.
### Analyzed Slices
The research itself might include thousands of slices from those human DNA genomesequences, that might vary in length - from a few dozens of nucleotides to millions ofthem.
### Short Sequences
We might also hold lots of short DNA sequences (from a few nucleotides to severalhundreds of them), that will later be used in DNA manipulation and analysis.
